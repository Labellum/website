# The Beginning

12-06-2025

My friends, this is only the _beginning_ for labellum.dev and the Labellum project as a whole.

## What is Labellum?

1. **A color theme**: For your development environment. Comes in two styles: 🏵️ Persica and 🌹 Rose Madder Deep

2. **Celia**: A tmux plugin that turns the status bar stylish and easily customizable. Designed to automatically use the colors of whatever theme your terminal is already using. (Which is hopefully Labellum 🙃) However, custom themes are supported if the auto-theme doesn't look right.

3. **A website**: Which you're currently on! 😺
